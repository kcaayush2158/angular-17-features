    Signal-based components are a new feature in Angular 17 that provide a more efficient and predictable way to write reactive code. Signal-based components are built on top of Angular's existing reactivity model, but they provide a number of enhancements that make them easier to use and more performant.

    Benefits of signal-based components
  </h1>
  <br>
  <p>Signal-based components offer a number of benefits over traditional Angular components:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Predictable performance : </b>Signal-based components only re-render when their inputs change. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially for complex applications.</li>
    <li> <b>Cleaner code : </b>Signal-based components make it easier to write code that is both reactive and easy to understand. This is because inputs are read-only inside signal-based components, which helps to prevent accidental state mutation.
    </li>
    <li> <b>Better debugging: </b>  Signal-based components make it easier to debug reactive applications. This is because signal emissions are logged to the console, which can help you to track down the source of any problems.</li>
  </ul>
